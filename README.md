Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet strategic game that has been enjoyed by people of all ages for generations. The objective is to be the first player to get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on a 3x3 grid.

This version of Tic-Tac-Toe is designed for one player, who plays as 'X', against a computer opponent, which plays as 'O'. The computer AI uses basic strategies to make its moves, providing a tough challenge to the player. 
The game is played entirely through the command line, making it a great way to practice Python programming and understand the fundamentals of game development.

P.S you cannot win against the computer!

Key features of this project include:
A clear and interactive command-line interface.
Basic AI for the computer opponent that prevents the player from winning easily while trying to win itself.
A lightweight, dependency-free implementation that runs on any system with Python installed.

This project is ideal for beginners who are learning Python, as well as for experienced developers who want to experiment with AI logic in games.
